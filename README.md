File Structure
aconex_scraper/
‚îú‚îÄ emails.py        # Handles login and email extraction
‚îú‚îÄ doc.py           # Handles document extraction
‚îú‚îÄ workflows.py     # Handles workflow extraction
‚îú‚îÄ main.py          # Main script to execute all extractions
‚îú‚îÄ README.md        # Project documentation

Usage
1. Set up credentials and paths

In main.py, set your Aconex username, password, and export folder path:

user_name = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
folder_path = "path_to_save_files"
emails_file_name = "emails.csv"
docs_file_name = "docs.xlsx"

python main.py


The script will:
